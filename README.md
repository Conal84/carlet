### Strategy
The Carlet website will provide visitors with an easy to use search facility where they can find cars to hire in their location.

Users will have the ability to upload a car to let / hire out to other site users.

Users will can create a personal account where they can login to see their current and previous car hires and car lets.

Users can easily add products to their cart, view their cart total, cart items and can use a checkout to enter their payment details and confirm their order.

Users orders will be confirmed by a personal email sent to their email account.

Admin users will be able to create, view, update or delete products or users from the website by logging in with admin rights.

This portfolio website will be aimed at a range of demographics, both male and female from 18 years plus.
As a result of this wide range of users the site must be simple to use and laid out in a concise manner with a simple explanation of how the car hiring process works.
The color palette of the site must also appeal to these demographics.

### Scope
Website key features include the following;



### Structure
I want to use bright but neutral colors to attract users from a variety of demographics to the website.

### Features to implement

## Testing
Please see the TEST.md file at this link [TEST.md](TEST.md) to understand how the Car-Let website was tested.

## Deployment
This project was developed using the GitPod IDE, version controlled by committing to git and pushing to GitHub via the GitPod IDE.
The deployment instructions have been written for a macOS specifically, therefore the commands and installation may differ slightly for your machine.

### How to run this project locally
The following must be installed on your machine;
* PIP
* Python 3
* GitHub

#### instructions

2. Click on **Clone or Download** and copy the URL
3. In your IDE enter the command 
4. A virtual environment is recommended for the Python interpreter, I recommend using Pythons built in virtual environment. To do this enter the command
5. Activate the virtual environment with the command 
6. If required upgrade pip locally with the command
7. Install all required packages from the requirements file with the command
